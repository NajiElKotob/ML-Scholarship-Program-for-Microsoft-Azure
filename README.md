# Udacity - Machine Learning Scholarship Program for Microsoft Azure

## Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure
* [What’s the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning?](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/) (Michael Copeland, Jul. 2016)
* Traditional Programming takes Rule + Data to output Answers, but Machine Learning learns Rules from Answers + Data. _[read more](https://www.logianalytics.com/predictive-analytics/machine-learning-vs-traditional-programming)_
* [The Beginner’s Guide to Text Vectorization](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/beginners-guide-text-vectorization/) (Rodrigo Stecanella, Sep. 2017)
* [Underfitting vs. Overfitting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html) - Understanding model fit is important for understanding the root cause for poor model accuracy. We can determine whether a predictive model is underfitting or overfitting the training data by looking at the prediction error on the training data and the evaluation data.

## Remember
* All deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms but not all machine learning algorithms are deep learning algorithms.
* Deep learning algorithms are based on neural networks.
* Classical ML algorithms are based on classical mathematical algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, etc.
* Model = Algorithm(Data)
* There are three main approaches to machine learning; Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.
* Feature learning aka Representation learning
* Parametric and linear algorithms often have high bias and low variance, whereas non-parametric and non-linear algorithms often have low bias and high variance
* ML Prediction Error = Bias error + variance + error + irreducible error
* Datastores offer a layer of abstraction over the supported Azure storage services.
* Datasets are used to get specific data files in the datastores.
