* Traditional Programming takes Rule + Data to output Answers, but Machine Learning learns Rules from Answers + Data. _[read more](https://www.logianalytics.com/predictive-analytics/machine-learning-vs-traditional-programming)_

* [Underfitting vs. Overfitting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html) - Understanding model fit is important for understanding the root cause for poor model accuracy. We can determine whether a predictive model is underfitting or overfitting the training data by looking at the prediction error on the training data and the evaluation data.

## Remember
* All deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms but not all machine learning algorithms are deep learning algorithms.
* Deep learning algorithms are based on neural networks.
* Classical ML algorithms are based on classical mathematical algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, etc.
* Model = Algorithm(Data)
* There are three main approaches to machine learning; Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.
* Feature learning aka Representation learning
* Parametric and linear algorithms often have high bias and low variance, whereas non-parametric and non-linear algorithms often have low bias and high variance
* ML Prediction Error = Bias error + variance + error + irreducible error

## Terms and Definition
* Machine Learning
  * Machine Learning algorithms aim to learn a target function (f) that describes the mapping between data input variables (X) and an output variable (Y) | Y=f(X)+e (Udacity)
  * **Machine learning** is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends (Udacity)
* [Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines#what-are-azure-ml-pipelines) An Azure ML pipeline performs a complete logical workflow with an ordered sequence of steps. Each step is a discrete processing action. (Microsoft Azure)
* In the context of machine learning, [data drift](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-data-drift#what-is-data-drift)  is the change in model input data that leads to model performance degradation. It is one of the top reasons where model accuracy degrades over time, thus monitoring data drift helps detect model performance issues.
* **Irreducible error** is the error that can’t be reduced by creating good models. It is a measure of the amount of noise in our data. Here it is important to understand that no matter how good we make our model, our data will have certain amount of noise or irreducible error that can not be removed. [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-bias-variance-tradeoff-165e6942b229). Irreducible Error comes from data collection.
